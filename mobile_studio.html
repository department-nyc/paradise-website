					Welcome to Paradise.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the most widely accepted interpretations of Paradise is the Garden of Eden, home of Adam and Eve before they made a mess of it by eating some fruit. But there are as many notions of Paradise as there are people dreaming of it.
				</p>
				<p>
					For some, Paradise is a hammock swaying between two palms on a deserted beach; for others, Paradise is an ice-cold beer at 5:15 on a Friday, or dinner and a movie–minus the kids. Some people even find Paradise to be a town directly adjacent to the city of Las Vegas. Which it is, actually.
				</p>
				<p>
					For us, though, Paradise is our design and product studio. That’s what we called it–Paradise. And it happens to be the source of literal Paradise for us, because here we get to take our vast knowledge and experience working in-house for some of today’s best brands, and use it to create new and supernaturally original ideas for others. It’s our background experience that sets us apart. We’ve been in the trenches and that gives us our edge.
				</p>
				<p>
					In short, we know our shit, and that’s Paradise.

								In the Trenches.
							</span>
							Our time spent in-house has given us insights into the customer feedback loop that many agencies never get access to. Launching award winning product lines with some of the most innovative marketing, sales, design and operations teams has taught us the complex balancing act of brand and business.

								New York City + Sydney.
							</span>
							Travel is a key part of how we operate and the brands and products we create reflect that. And offices on directly opposite sides of the world means our team literally works around the clock.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="studio__service-group">
						<p>
							<span class="studio__service-title">
								Skin In The Game.
							</span>
							We've built our own brands from the ground up. And we’re still doing it. We've had successes, but more importantly failures. We’ve bounced back bigger and badder than ever. We feel your pain and understand the ever-changing landscape because we live and learn in it everyday.

						<p>
							<span class="studio__service-title">
								We Discover.
							</span>
							We look at the big picture and how your brand fits into it. Where are you now and where do you want to be? You know your brand best–tell us about it. We listen. We nod. We hold our chins. We remove our glasses and suck on the stem. Then we blow your ever-lovin’ socks off.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="studio__service-group">
						<p>
							<span class="studio__service-title">
								We Strategize.
							</span>
							We take the big questions into consideration: how will you stand out? Who are you? Why does your company exist? Why do you exist? Do you exist? Is anything real? Where am I? Then we blow your ever-lovin’ socks off a second time.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="studio__service-group">
						<p>
							<span class="studio__service-title">
								We Play.
							</span>
							All the best ideas come from controlled chaos, and we are very good at controlled chaos. This is where experience makes way to intuition, and where truly original and compelling ideas are born. And if your feet are cold that’s because your socks just went missing again.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="studio__services-group">
						<p>
							<span class="studio__service-title">
								We Execute.
							</span>
							We build the product/brand in a way that makes it stand out. The brand has something to say and we help it say it loud. Next thing you know–BAM! Where’d your socks go?
