					Welcome to Paradise.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the most widely accepted interpretations of Paradise is the Garden of Eden, home to Adam and Eve before they got kicked out for eating <span class="hover-effect">fruit</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
					But there are as many notions of Paradise as there are people dreaming of it. For some, Paradise is a <span class="hover-effect">hammock</span> swaying between palms on a deserted beach; for others, Paradise is an <span class="hover-effect">ice-cold</span> beer at 5:15 on a Friday, or dinner and a movie–<span class="hover-effect">minus the kids.</span> Some people even find Paradise while being struck with a <span class="hover-effect">pizza shovel</span> in the basement of a nightclub.
				</p>
				<p>
					For us, Paradise is our design and product studio. That’s what we called it– Paradise. And it happens to be our source of literal Paradise because it’s here that we’re able to take our knowledge and past experience working in-house for brands, and use it to create hard hitting and <span class="hover-effect">award winning</span> new work for others. Our background sets us apart: we’ve been <span class="hover-effect">in the trenches</span> and we know our shit. That’s Paradise.

								In the Trenches.

							Our time spent in-house has given us insights into the customer feedback loop that many agencies never get access to. Launching award winning product lines with some of the most innovative marketing, sales, design and operations teams has taught us the complex balancing act of brand and business

							We've built our own brands from the ground up. And we’re still doing it. We've had successes, but more importantly failures. We’ve bounced back bigger and badder than ever. We feel your pain and understand the ever-changing landscape because we live and learn in it everyday.

						— How We Do It
					</div>

						<p>
							<span class="studio__service-title">
								We Discover.
							</span>
							We look at the big picture and how your brand fits into it. Where are you now and where do you want to be? You know your brand best–tell us about it. We listen. We nod. We hold our chins. We remove our glasses and suck on the stem. Then we blow your ever-lovin’ socks off.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="studio__service-group">
						<p>
							<span class="studio__service-title">
								We Strategize.
							</span>
							We take the big questions into consideration: how will you stand out? Who are you? Why does your company exist? Why do you exist? Do you exist? Is anything real? Where am I? Then we blow your ever-lovin’ socks off a second time.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="studio__service-group">
						<p>
							<span class="studio__service-title">
								We Play.
							</span>
							All the best ideas come from controlled chaos, and we are very good at controlled chaos. This is where experience makes way to intuition, and where truly original and compelling ideas are born. And if your feet are cold that’s because your socks just went missing again.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="studio__services-group">
						<p>
							<span class="studio__service-title">
								We Execute.
							</span>
							We build the product/brand in a way that makes it stand out. The brand has something to say and we help it say it loud. Next thing you know–BAM! Where’d your socks go?
