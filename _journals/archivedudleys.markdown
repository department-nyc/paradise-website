The archives are getting us sentimental with an old neighborhood favorite of ours- Dudley's. We worked with this team of champions when they opened in 2012 to create a wordmark and accompanying custom typeface that continue to live across a range of printed collateral.

If you are in the neighborhood stop in for a Bronte Burger and tell them "hello from Paradise."
