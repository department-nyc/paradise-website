Some beautiful shots by our mates at [Wedge & Lever](http://www.wedgeandlever.com/) of a sleek contemporary line of belts we designed for the recently launched online belt startup [Upton](http://uptonbelts.com/).

The concept was to put a modern spin on the classic men's belt across three different styles. We achieved a minimal machined symmetry in a space where traditionally more emphasis is placed on a handcrafted feel. The design and production of the buckles required some innovative design thinking around molding without parting lines in order to reduce the amount of polishing required and therefore the amount of damage that would be done to the edges.

We worked on a strictly product level on this one with the Wedge & Lever crew executing the branding, packaging, all of the amazing photography and art direction and some intense Orwellian brand videos that you can see more of [here](http://www.wedgeandlever.com/portfolio/upton-belts/). Bravo gents.
