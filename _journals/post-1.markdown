Jack Erwin is a direct-to-consumer luxury mens shoe brand. After two years of quick growth and success, we were engaged to hone Jack Erwinâ€™s brand story. This meant rethinking their branded materials as a holistic system.

We evolved the logo mark, introduced consistent color and textures, art directed campaigns shot by Bjorn Iooss and Joss Mckinley, and introduced an intuitive e-commerce experience. The results was a brand that was confident, aspirational, understated, and truly reflected the men purchasing and wearing JE shoes.
