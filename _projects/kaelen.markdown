  excerpt: 'Capturing **Kaelen**''s minimalist design essence and attention to detail
    in print. '
  body: "Kaelen is a NYC based women’s clothing line created by Kaelen Haworth, selected
    as 1 of 10 designers of CFDA'S {FASHION INCUBATOR} Class 3.0 The Kaelen collections
    explore the dichotomies of masculine and feminine, classic and contemporary with
    an emphasis on subtle detail and textile. Paradise was first engaged to create
    a print and digital brand book for Kaelen, to send to potential retailers. We
    were then engaged to adapt this brand book to a larger, more buttoned-up book
    that would act as her final CFDA submission.\n\n\nWe created a small pink brand
    book that tapped into Kaelen’s more cheeky, fun brand voice. Layouts were clean,
    juxtaposing themes of each collection and emphasizing textile and garment details.
    At the heart of the book, we contrasted the clean spreads with collage style pages
    printed on pink paper. This section was used introduced the Kaelen story, weaving
    together images of her inspiration, travels and process. \n\nWe created a bold
    and simple user interface to house the lookbook online, playing with arrow cursors
    and large page updating page numbers.  \n\n\nThe goal for the second lookbook
    was to create a beautiful object that felt sturdy, timeless and quintessentially
    Kaelen — so our emphasis was on the book cover and case. We needed something equally
    feminine and masculine, subtle and bold.  The cover became timeless: no branding,
    grey linen and an inset macro photograph. In contrast, we created a more contemporary,
    and heavy transparent plexi-glass sleeve, with the etched Kaelen logo.  "
