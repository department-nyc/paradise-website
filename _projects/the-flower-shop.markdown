  excerpt: 'We needed to create a vision that provoked the same trust between cobbler
    and man. Guarantee quality, product - and lifestyle. '
  body: "Jack Erwin is a direct-to-consumer luxury mens shoe brand. After two years
    of quick growtah and success, we were engaged to hone Jack Erwinâ€™s brand story.
    This meant rethinking their branded materials as \x03a holistic system. \n\nWe
    evolved the logo mark, introduced consistent color and textures, art directed
    campaigns shot by Bjorn Iooss and Joss Mckinley, and introduced an intuitive e-commerce
    experience. The results was a brand that was confident, aspirational, understated,
    and truly reflected the men purchasing and wearing JE shoes. \n\n\n* List Item
