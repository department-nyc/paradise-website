  excerpt: Capturing the spirit of rebellion with a bold new platform.
  body: "In early 2015, Pete Maiden set out to merge his two business ventures — media
    company featuring Aussie’s in the states, Billabout, - and his nolita retail location,
    B_Space, featuring up and coming Australian brands. Paradise was asked to define
    the new brand - Convicts - and create a cohesive editorial platform for it to
    exist on.\n\nKeeping in mind the camaraderie, pioneering nature and burning rebellion
    of the Convict, we created a clean logo mark inspired by the \"Pheon\" or \"Broad
    Arrow\" that marked British Government issued convict clothing in the early days
    of colonial Australia and paired it with flexible, modular and bold visual vernacular.
    We created a logo and visual system that embodied and could represent the rebellion,
    camaraderie of those pioneering new creative territory and spicing the world with
    mischief. "
