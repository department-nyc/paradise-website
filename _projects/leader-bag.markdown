  excerpt: |
    Designing a contemporary & utilitarian diaper bag that fits the modern family for **Leader Bag Co.**
  body: "Founded in 2013 by three mothers - and sisters - Leader Bag Co. gives modern
    parents a contemporary and stylish choice in an otherwise uninspiring sea of unicorns,
    polka dots and rainbows. Paradise was engaged to design this diaper bag and has
    since evolved into Leader’s creative consultant. In addition to two phases of
    product design and production, we’ve worked with Leader Bag Co on their product
    strategy and offering, managed their branding process while solidifying an overarching
    creative direction, and revamped their website to allow for a broader e-commerce
    experience that can grow as the product line does. With only two short years in
    market and Leader Bag Co.'s brand strength has allowed them to successfully transition
    into a predominantly pre-sale based sales model. \n\nThe ultimate goal for the
    Leader Bag Co. brand is to celebrate Moms and Dads, and to ease and facilitate
    the shared role of parenting. The bag design needed to reflect this. The inside
    of the bag was designed for function: pockets of different sizes, mesh elastic
    holders, water-repellent & wipe-clean fabrics and a pouch insert to hold a changing
    a Leader Bag changing mat & diapers. On the outside, the backpack is designed
    to be contemporary & gender neutral: waxed-canvas with leather accents in a neutral
    color palette. Keeping the parent & their babies in mind, we sourced safe fabrics,
    and produced with local, US manufacturers. \n\nTo match the back-pack design,
    we contracted New York based designer Lotta Nieminen to develop a mark and visual
    system to reflect the quality and values of Leader Bag Co. Our recent update to
    the website introduces an intuitive e-commerce experience with a stronger narrative
    explaining the function of the products & modular system that will expand with
    the brand and their product line.\n\n\n* Brand Strategy\n\n* Creative Direction\n\n*
