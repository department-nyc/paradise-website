  excerpt: 'Creating consistency across all branded materials with **Saturdays**. '
  body: "Saturdays is a lifestyle clothing brand born from the rituals of surfing:
    clothing, conversation, coffee and curation. Saturdays & Paradise have collaborated
    on a series of small projects that has posed an interested, and relevant, design
    challenge: how do we create consistency for a brand while constantly evolving
    the system across multiple channels. Our work with Saturdays includes art directing
    for season lookbooks, curating and designing Issue 4 of the Saturdays Magazine,
    creating the Saturdays Coffee packaging and curating an artist-collaboration series
    and digital design to accompany it. \n\n* Art Direction\n* Digital \n* Branded
