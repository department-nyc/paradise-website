  excerpt: Telling the story of the contemporary cobbler.
  body: "Jack Erwin, founded in 2013, is a direct-to-consumer mens shoe brands that
    provides seasonal luxury shoes at an affordable price. After two years of quick
    growth and success, we were engaged to hone Jack Erwinâ€™s brand story, which meant
    rethinking their branded materials and digital experience as a holistic system.
    \n\nIn order to create a brand that modern men could relate to, we needed to create
    a vision that provoked the same trust between cobbler and man: Guarantee quality,
    product - and lifestyle. We evolved the logo mark, introduced consistent color
    and texture across printed material and store design. We art directed campaigns
    shot by Bjorn Iooss and Joss Mckinley to use across a new intuitive e-commerce
    experience. The result was a brand that was confident, aspirational, understated,
    and truly reflected the men purchasing and wearing JE shoes. \n\n* *Art Direction*\n*
