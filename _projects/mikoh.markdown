  excerpt: |
    An adventurous new category for the endless summer wonders
  body: "Mikoh is a colorful and luxurious swimwear brand created by and inspired
    by the lives of sister duo Oleema and Kalani Miller. Mikoh reached out to Paradise
    to create seasonal textile patterns, and to create styles for their introductory
    eyewear line. \n\n\nEach season, we collaborate with Mikoh to create 5-10 swimwear
    patterns. We draw inspiration from what is the essence of the Mikoh brand: the
    textures, patterns, colors and beautiful nuances of the ocean and flora found
    at the beach.\n\n\nWe also worked with Mikoh to expand their product line, and
    launch their first eyewear collection. We created three unique styles: two bold,
    60â€™s inspired frames in sleek black, khaki and beige acetate. The glasses were
    unified with consistent details: silver plating on the left side of the sunglass
    arms and a silver plate for branding. All lenses are polarized for maximum UV
    protection and clarity."
