  excerpt: Jägermeister Partners with Mustard, Smino & EarthGang for “**Meister Class**”
    sessions.
  body: "Mikoh is a colorful and luxurious swimwear brand created by and inspired
    by the lives of sister duo Oleema and Kalani Miller. Paradise have a longstanding
    relationship with Mikoh collaborating on seasonal textile prints, and in 2015
    helped launch their debut eyewear line by way of design, manufacturing, product
    photography, packaging and lookbook design.\n\nSeasonally we draw inspiration
    for the swim prints from what is the essence of the Mikoh brand: the textures,
    patterns, colors and beautiful nuances of the ocean and flora found in an endless
    life aquatic.\n\nFor the introduction of their debut eyewear line we created three
    unique styles: two bold, 60’s inspired frames in sleek black, kelp and sand acetate,
    and a classic, lightweight, all-titanium aviator. The frames were unified with
    consistent details: a solid machined and polished bar sitting low on the temples
    and matching branded inserts at the temple tips. All lenses are polarized for
    maximum UV protection and clarity. All pieces were handmade by our manufacturing
    partners in Japan to the highest quality standards. "
