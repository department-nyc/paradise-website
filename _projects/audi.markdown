  excerpt: Honing **Jack Erwin**'s brand experience to tell the story of the contemporary
    cobbler.
  body: |
    Founded in 2013, Jack Erwin is a direct-to-consumer luxury mens shoe brand. Their point of differentiation: handmade Italian shoes at an affordable price. After two years of quick growth and success, we were engaged to hone Jack Erwinâ€™s brand story, which meant rethinking their branded materials and digital experience as a holistic system.

    We created a brand that modern men could relate to. We designed a visual system that provoked the same trust between cobbler and man: Guarantee quality, product - and lifestyle. We evolved the logo mark, introduced consistent color and texture across printed material and in store. We art directed Spring and Fall campaigns, and directed the use of these assets across their digital channels. Last, we revamped their e-commerce experience by introducing a simplified content strategy, and strong branded elements throughout the website. The result was a brand that was confident, aspirational, understated, and truly reflected the men purchasing and wearing JE shoes.
